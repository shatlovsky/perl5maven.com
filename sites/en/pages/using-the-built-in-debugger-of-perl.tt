The new screencast is about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiYZcV3khdY">using the built-in debugger of Perl</a>.
I gave talks about this at various Perl workshops and conferences and there were always lots of
people who have never used the debugger. I hope this will help more people to start using it.

Running the debugger:

perl -d yourscript.pl param param

The debugger commands that were mentioned in this video are:

q - to quit

h - to get the help

p - to print

s - step in

n - step over

r - step out

T - stack trace

l - listing code

I also recommend to read the book of Richard Foley and Andy Lester: <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781590594544">Pro Perl Debugging</a>
